# odin-recipes

This is a first step to practice the knowledge learnt with "The Odin Project"
curriculum. 

In the first step I will build the structure of a recipe website using HTML and
GIT.

Creating home file and one recipe I've decided to change my way, I should've 
search the recipes I want to post and after that create the html documents and
later build the links on index.

Doing as many commits as needed to start getting comfy with git. I'm sure I will
get better with it but right now I need to practice all the steps needed.
